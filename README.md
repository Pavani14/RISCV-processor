# RISCV-processor
Aim: Developing a functional model of riscv base integer instruction set using ArchC

To simulate the model perform the following steps:

1. Download the source code in the directory where the rest of the processors of ArchC model are installed.

2. Go to the directory where ArchC is installed and perform the following on terminal: 

    (assuming it to be acinstall)
    cd acinstall/processors
    cd riscv
    cd riscv-1.0
    acsim riscv.ac
